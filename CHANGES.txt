0.5.0, in preparation

    - Job configuration expanded to include status patterns and a note.
      These patterns are regular expressions to be compared to the job output.
      (A SQLite update script is provided: util/update_2014-07-09.sql.)
    - Client timeout added for communication with server (Python 2.6+ only).
    - Ability to "inhibit" the execution of Cron jobs added.
      (A SQLite update script is provided: util/update_2014-08-05.sql.)
    - Support for MySQL added as an alternative to SQLite.
    - Added crabd options to import and export job configuration.
    - Added 30 second delay before marking jobs as "late".
    - Check if /etc/localtime is a symlink when trying to guess a client's
      timezone in case the system has multiple identical timezones.
    - A new clean service can remove old events from storage.
      (When job output is stored in the database, this requires a
      minor schema update.  SQLite and MySQL update scripts are provided:
      util/update_2016-01-06_sqlite.sql and util/update_2016-01-06_mysql.sql.)

0.4.2, 2014-02-21

    - Now support Font Awesome version 4.  Since this version breaks
      compatability with version 3, existing installations of the Crab
      server being updated will also need an updated Font Awesome,
      including renaming the res/font directory to res/fonts.
    - Added internal pidfile support to crabd.  This uses the
      crab.util.pid module which is also used by crabsh.

0.4.1, 2013-09-04

    - Avoid an error when two threads attempt to create the same
      directory at the same time.

0.4.0, 2013-08-29

    - When used to report job finish events, the crab utility now
      supports --stdout and --stderr options.
    - A new status code 'WARNING' has been added for generic
      client-generated warnings for which 'UNKNOWN' is not appropriate.
    - Jobs can be marked as deleted and job identifiers can be changed
      via the web interface.
    - A new environment variable CRABUSERCONFIG can be set to change
      the directory searched for user level configuration files.
    - Job output with ANSI colors can be colored if the ansi_up
      JavaScipt library is installed.
    - Times related to jobs without specified timezones are now shown
      in a common timezone instead of as raw database output.
    - Signals SIGPIPE and SIGCONT/XFSZ are restored by the crabsh wrapper
      script before invoking commands in versions of Python before 3.2.
    - An edit command has been added to the crab utility as a convenient
      alternative to running "crontab -e" and then "crab import".

0.3.0, 2013-03-28

    - Empty job output is no longer stored.
    - JavaScript uses RegExp instead of replace with 'g' option to avoid
      problems with browsers which do not support it.
    - Two new status codes have been added: 'CLEARED' and 'ALREADYRUNNING'.
    - The web interface now provides an option to clear the status of
      a job, returning it to a green color on the dashboard by inserting a
      'CLEARED' event.
    - Added a basic pidfile module which crabsh can use to detect that a job
      is already running and send an 'ALREADYRUNNING' status instead of
      starting it again.
    - Improved parsing of CRAB variables with the intention that crabsh
      and crabd both consisently combine variables from the environment
      with those specified at the start of a job command line.
    - CRABIGNORE now prevents crabsh reporting the status of a job.
    - PyRSS2Gen is now an optional dependency, and if it is not present,
      the RSS button will not be shown.

0.2.0, 2012-10-17

    - Minor update to the database schema to replace confusing names.
      (A corresponding SQLite update script is provided in the util directory.)
    - Job output and raw crontabs can now optionally be saved in files instead
      of in the database.
    - The base URL used in email notifications and the RSS feed is now
      configurable.
    - Added history navigation to the job pages.
    - Headings on the dashboard page can be clicked to sort the table.

0.1.0, 2012-10-05

    - Initial release.
